最近,纽约动物医疗中心对 132 只猫进行了为期5个月 的综合研究。所有这些猫都有一个共同的经历:它们都曾从高层建筑上摔下来过,但只有其中的8只猫死于震荡或跌伤。当然,纽约是进行这种有趣的试验的一个理想的地方,因为那里根本不缺乏高楼大厦,有的是高层的窗槛从上往下坠落。有一只叫萨伯瑞娜的猫从 32层楼上掉下来,但只捧断了一颗牙 。“猫就像训练有素的跳伞队员,”一位医生说。看起来,猫跌落的距离越长它们就越不会伤害自己。在一个长长的跌落过程中,它们可以达到每小时 60 英里甚至更快的速度。在高速下落中、猫有时间放松自己。它们伸展开四肢,就像飞行中的松鼠一样。这样就加大了空气阻力,并减小了它们着地时冲击力带来的震动 。

Cats never fail to fascinate human beings. They can be friendly and affectionate towards humans, but they lead mysterious lives of their own as well. They never become submissive like dogs and horses. As a result, humans have learned to respect feline independence. Most cats remain suspicious of humans all their lives. One of the things that fascinate us most about cats is the popular belief that they have nine lives. Apparently, there us a good deal of truth in this idea. A cat's ability to survive falls is based on fact.

There are <span style="color:#0A0">a</span> plenty of high-rise windowsills to fall<span style="color:#A00">form! One cat, Sabrina, fell 32 storeys, yet only suffered</span> from<span style="color:#A00">a broken tooth. 'Cats behave like well-trained paratroopers,' a doctor said. It seems that the further cats fall, the less they are likely to injure themselves. In a long drop, they reach speeds of 60 miles an hour and more. At high speeds, falling cats have time to relax. They stretch out their legs like flying squirrels. This increases their air-resistance and reduces the shock of impact when they hit the ground.</span>
