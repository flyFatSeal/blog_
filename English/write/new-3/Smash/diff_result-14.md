皮卡迪利大街附近的一条著名拱廊街道上，几家高档商店刚刚开始营业。在早晨的这个时候、拱廊街上几乎空无一人。珠宝店主泰勒先生正在欣赏新布置的橱窗。他手下两名店员从早上8点就开始忙碌，这时刚刚布置完毕。钻石项链、戒指漂亮地陈列在黑色丝绒上面。泰勒先生站在橱窗外凝神欣赏了几分钟就回到了店里。
宁静突然被打破，一辆大轿车亮着前灯，响着喇叭，呼啸着冲进了拱廊街，在珠宝店门口停了下来，一人留在驾驶座上，另外两个用黑色长筒丝袜蒙面的人跳下车来。他们用铁棒把商店橱窗玻璃砸碎。这一切发生时，泰勒先生正在楼上。他与店员动手向窗外投掷家具，椅子、桌子飞落到拱廊街上。一个窃贼被一尊很重的雕像击中，但由于他忙着抢钻石首饰，竟连疼痛都顾不上了。这场抢劫只持续了3分钟，因为窃贼争先恐后地爬上轿车，以惊人的速度开跑了。就在轿车离开的时候，泰勒先生从店里冲了出来，跟在车后追赶，一边还往车上扔烟灰缸、花瓶。但他已无法抓住那些窃贼了。他们已经带着价值数千镑的首饰逃之天天了。

After gazing<span style="color:#A00">at</span> the display for several minutes, Mr.Taylor went back into his shop. The silence was suddenly broken when a large car, with its headlights on and its horn <span style="color:#A00">blaring,</span><span style="color:#0A0">bloring,</span> roared down the arcade. It came to a stop outside the jeweller's. One man stayed at the wheel while two others with black stockings over their faces jumped out and smashed the window of the shop with iron bars. While this was going on, Mr.Taylor was upstairs. He and his staff began throwing <span style="color:#A00">furniture</span><span style="color:#0A0">furnitures</span> out of the window. Chairs and tables <span style="color:#A00">went</span><span style="color:#0A0">were</span> flying into the arcade.
