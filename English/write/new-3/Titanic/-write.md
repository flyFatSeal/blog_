巨轮“泰坦尼克”号 1912 年4月 10 日从南安普敦起锚驶向纽约,船上载有 1.316 名乘客与 891 名船员。即便用现代标准来衡量,46.000 吨的“泰坦尼克”号也算得上一艘巨轮了。当时,这艘轮船不仅是造船史上建造的最大的一艘船、而且也被认为是不会沉没的。因为船由 16 个密封舱组成.即使有两个舱进水,仍可漂浮在水面上。然而,这艘巨轮首航就下沉,造成大批人员死亡。人们将永远记着这艘巨轮的沉没惨剧。“泰坦尼克”起航后的第 4天,它正行驶在北大西洋冰冷的海面上。突然,瞭望员发现一座冰山。警报响过不久,巨轮急转弯、以避免与冰山正面相撞。“泰坦尼克”这个弯拐得及时、紧贴着高出海面 100 英尺的巨大的冰墙擦过去。突然，从船舱下部传来一声轻微的颤音,船长走下船舱去查看究竟,由于这个声音非常轻,没人会想到船身已遭损坏。在下面,船长惊恐地发现“泰坦尼克”号正在急速下沉,16 个密封舱已有5个进水。于是,他发出了弃船的命令,几百人跳进了冰冷刺骨的海水里。由于没有足够的救生艇运载所有乘客,结果 1500人丧生 。

The great ship, Titanic, sailed for New York from Southampton on April 10th, 1912. She was carrying 1,316 passengers and a crew of 891. Even by modern standards, the 46,000 ton Titanic was a colossal ship. At that time, however, she was not only the largest ship had ever been built, but was regarded as unsinkable, for she had sixteen watertight compartments. Even if two of these were flooded, she would still be able to float. The tragic sinking of this great liner will always be remembered, for she went down on her first voyage with heavy loss of life.
Four days after setting out, while the Titanic was sailing across the ice waters of the North Atlantic, a huge iceberg suddenly was spotted by a lookout. After the alarm had been given, the great ship turned sharply to avoid a direct colloise. The Titanic turned just in time, narrowing missing immense wall of the ice which rose over 100 feet of water. Suddenly, there was a slight trembing sound from below, the captain went down to see what had happened.
